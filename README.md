## Welcome to snpierce-pangrams

This is a self-made site that takes a dictionary file, loads it, and then uses it to generate pangrams (NYT Spelling Bee parameters) and solve inputted ones. It's a Flask application that can be run by cloning this repository, downloading required packages, and hosting the url on your local computer.
